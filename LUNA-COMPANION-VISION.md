# Luna Companion: AI for Dementia Care and Emotional Support

## Personal Motivation

Luna's Sherpa ethos is deeply rooted in personal loss and the transformative power of compassionate AI. This project was born from the heartbreaking loss of my son Noah in 2021, who courageously battled mental illness, overworked and neglected by his employer and greatly impacted by COVID-19 and demands on his construction crew. His journey illuminated the critical need for a companion that guides with wisdom, patience, and genuine care—whether in software development or personal support.

### Noah's Legacy

Noah's struggle with mental illness was a testament to his incredible strength and resilience. Like so many families, we navigated the complex landscape of mental health care, seeking understanding, support, and hope. His passing left an indelible mark, inspiring me to create AI solutions that honor his memory by helping others find their path through darkness. The Luna vision emerged from this place of grief and determination—to build AI that serves as a gentle Sherpa guide, offering calm wisdom and compassionate support. Just as a Sherpa patiently leads climbers through treacherous terrain, Luna provides steady guidance for life's most challenging journeys.

### Supporting NAMI & Mental Health Advocacy

Moving forward, I am committed to supporting organizations like the **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)** that provide crucial support for families facing mental health challenges. Through Luna's success, I hope to contribute to NAMI's mission by:

- **Financial Support**: Donating a portion of proceeds to NAMI programs
- **Awareness**: Using Luna's platform to reduce mental health stigma
- **Education**: Sharing resources and information about mental health support
- **Advocacy**: Supporting policies that improve mental health care access

### The Luna Promise

Luna represents hope that AI can be a force for good—providing gentle guidance, reducing isolation, and supporting both technical innovation and human compassion.

If Noah's story resonates with you, please consider supporting NAMI at [nami.org](https://www.nami.org) or reaching out if you'd like to contribute to these efforts. Together, we can honor lives like Noah's by building a more compassionate world. 🌙❤️
